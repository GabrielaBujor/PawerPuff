PawerPuff is an Android application aimed at facilitating dog adoptions. It allows users to browse through a list of available dogs, with options to adopt them physically or virtually. Virtual adoption is for users who want to support a dog financially, but cannot provide a physical home. Users can also donate items such as food and toys to the shelter.

**Technologies Used**
- **Java**: Used for its robust capabilities in building Android applications, enabling smooth functionality and interaction.
- **SQL**: Managed the database for storing user information, dog profiles, and adoption data.
- **Android Studio**: The main development environment for coding, testing, and debugging the application.
