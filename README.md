About: PawerPuff is an Android app designed for dog adoptions. Users can browse dogs for physical or virtual adoption, allowing those without space to still care for a dog by providing food and supplies.

Technologies Used: Java was chosen for its robust, object-oriented structure ideal for Android app development. SQL was used for managing user and adoption data efficiently, while Android Studio helped develop and test the app.
